# SolarOS Shell Commands

This document covers built-in shell commands. Foreground applications are
documented separately in [apps.md](apps.md). Command availability depends on the
compiled firmware flavor and board capabilities; `help` shows the commands in
the running image.

## Shell Conventions

Paths are resolved relative to the current shell directory. On the primary SD
volume, `/` is presented as the SD card root even though the internal mount path
is `/sdcard`.

Wildcard patterns are supported by selected filesystem commands, for example
`*.txt`.

Tab completion covers commands, subcommands, filesystem paths, job names, port
names, and stream IDs where the command exposes enough structure.

History is kept in memory and cached at `/.shell/history` when storage is
available. Optional startup and alias files:

```text
/.shell/startup
/.shell/alias
/.shell/user
/.shell/hostname
```

The display-shell app exit chord is `CTRL+ALT+DEL`. Port shells use `Ctrl+]`.

## Shell Control

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `help` | `help` | List built-in shell commands. |
| `clear` | `clear` | Clear the active shell terminal. |
| `watch` | `watch [-n seconds] <command> [args...]` | Repeat another shell command until `Esc`, `q`, or the app-exit key is pressed. |
| `sh` | `sh <file>` | Run a simple SolarOS shell script from storage. |
| `reboot` | `reboot` | Restart the board. |
| `sessions` | `sessions` | List display foreground app sessions. |
| `fg` | `fg <session-id>` | Resume a display foreground app session. |
| `close` | `close <session-id>` | Close a display foreground app session. |

Sessions are foreground application state. Background services such as log
followers, SLIP, DAQ, and HTTP serving are jobs and are controlled with `job`.

Scripts are intentionally simple. `sh` skips blank lines and lines whose first
non-space character is `#`, then executes each remaining line as a normal shell
command. There are no variables, pipes, redirects, or conditionals yet.

Aliases are stored in `/.shell/alias`, one per line:

```text
name command-or-app fixed-args...
```

Arguments typed after the alias are appended.

## System And Diagnostics

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | `version` | Print SolarOS version, board, flavor, and package information. |
| `pkg` | `pkg` | Print compiled package groups and build units. |
| `board` | `board` | Print board ID, name, and capabilities. |
| `status` | `status` | Print a compact system status summary. |
| `uptime` | `uptime` | Print elapsed time since boot. |
| `mem` | `mem` | Print internal RAM, PSRAM, and DMA memory status. |
| `top` | `top` | Print FreeRTOS task resource information when available. |
| `sleep` | `sleep` | Enter explicit light sleep. |
| `power` | See below | Inspect and configure power policy. |
| `setterm` | See below | Configure terminal/input preferences. Without arguments, opens the display TUI when available. |

`power` usage:

```text
power status
power profile [performance|balanced|solar|offline]
power idle [off|seconds]
power key [off|light]
power sleep
```

Profiles:

| Profile | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `performance` | Maximum configured CPU frequency, no automatic light sleep. |
| `balanced` | CPU frequency scaling down to 80 MHz, no automatic light sleep. This is the default. |
| `solar` | CPU capped at 80 MHz with ESP-IDF automatic light sleep. |
| `offline` | CPU capped at 80 MHz, automatic light sleep, and display-shell idle sleep after 60 seconds. |

`setterm` usage:

```text
setterm
setterm orientation [0|90|180|270]
setterm font [mono|compact]
setterm textsize [12|14|16|18|20]
setterm keyboard [us|de]
setterm keyrate [off|1..60 [delay-ms]]
setterm timezone [UTC|Europe/Berlin|POSIX-TZ]
setterm otaurl [url]
```

## Apps And Jobs

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps` | `apps` | List registered foreground apps compiled into the firmware. |
| `jobs` | `jobs` | List registered jobs and their state. |
| `job` | `job status [name]` | Show one job or all jobs. |
| `job` | `job start <name> [args...]` | Start or restart a job. |
| `job` | `job stop <name>` | Stop a job. |
| `session` | `session list` | List display app sessions and port shell sessions. |
| `session` | `session create shell <port>` | Start a VT100 shell session on a byte-stream port. |
| `session` | `session fg <id>` or `session switch <id>` | Resume a display app session. |
| `session` | `session close <id>` | Close a display app session or stop a port shell session. |

`jobs` prints a compact table that fits the built-in display terminal:

```text
NAME         STATE    KIND        EVT  TICKS RES
batmon       running  background  tick    17   1
log          stopped  background  tick     0   0
```

Columns:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NAME` | Job registry name. |
| `STATE` | `stopped`, `running`, or `failed`. |
| `KIND` | Job kind. Current registry jobs are background workers. |
| `EVT` | `tick` if the job receives periodic tick events, otherwise `-`. |
| `TICKS` | Number of dispatched tick events while running. |
| `RES` | Number of resources currently recorded for the job. |

Use `job status <name>` for the job summary, owner string, last error, and
resource details. Job-owned resources use owner strings such as `job:log`; port
conflicts are reported as readable messages such as `job log owns cdc0`.

Common job examples:

```text
session create shell cdc0
session create shell uart0
job start log cdc0
job start log file /.shell/log info
job start bridge cdc0 uart0
job start httpd /www
job start ntp-sync once
job start batmon 60
job start slip uart0 115200
job stop log
```

Only one instance of each built-in job name is active at a time. Starting the
same job again stops the previous instance and starts it with the new arguments.

daq start /logs/key.csv gpio17 --changes
daq start /logs/uart0.bin uart0 --raw --rate-ms 25
```

`daq` CSV rows include `uptime_ms`, and include UTC `time_ms` when RTC time is
trusted. Raw mode is byte-stream only, single-stream only, and writes bytes
directly without CSV framing.

Transfer usage:

```text
xfer protocols
xfer send <port> <file> --raw [-d ms]
xfer recv <port> <file> --raw [--append|--replace] [--idle-ms ms]

xfer recv <port> <file> --zmodem [--append|--replace]
```

`raw` and `zmodem` are supported. `kermit` is reserved but not implemented.

`mqtt connect mqtt://host[:port] [username [password]]` and
`mqtt connect mqtts://host[:port] [username [password]]` save broker settings
in NVS. Later `mqtt connect` reuses the saved settings.

`netscan` accepts a host, same-subnet range, or compact range form. Examples:

```text
netscan 192.168.1.10 22,80,443
netscan 192.168.1.1-50 22
netscan wintermute 22

configured release index, verifies the signed index, verifies firmware SHA-256,
and writes the inactive ESP-IDF OTA partition.
